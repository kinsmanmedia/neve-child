            <p>The Mississauga Arts Council acknowledges that the land on which we gather is part of the Treaty and Traditional Territory of the Mississaugaâ€™s of the Credit First Nation, The Haudenosaunee Confederacy, the Huron-Wendat and Wyandot Nations. We are grateful to have the opportunity to work on this land, and give our respect to these peoples and their ancestors who have been inhabitants of this land since time immemorial. We also recognize that Mississauga is now home to many global Indigenous Peoples.</p>
